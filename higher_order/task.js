/*
Task: (10 minutes)
Using the forEach method, complete the following tasks:

Write a function called getEvens that takes an array of numbers as 
an argument and returns a new array that only contains the even numbers 
from the original array.
Write a function called sumElements that takes an array of numbers as 
an argument and returns the sum total of all the elements in the array.
Hint: If you get stuck, start by writing the function using a for of loop, 
then refactor, replacing the for loop with the forEach.
